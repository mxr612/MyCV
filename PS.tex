% VIA24+Interest code

Interest test summary code (``Holland Code'') reveals my preference of investigate
I am interested in various kind of things, nearly any known unknowns.
I would like to do explorations in life, sensing the world around me.
Following my curiosity and the love of learning\dots
% openness
As a person characterized by high levels of openness, my fascination with understanding human behaviour and the underlying psychological mechanisms has always resonated deeply within me.
I embrace the beauty in diversity, longing to explore the myriad complexities of human behaviour and the psychological underpinnings that define our existence, and finding immense satisfaction in interacting with diverse groups of people, striving to comprehend their varied perspectives.
This intrinsic curiosity has led me down the path of psychology, fostering a commitment to explore cultural and Corss-cultural psychology in particular.

The world is an amalgamation of numerous cultures with unique attitudes, behaviours, and symbols.
Therefore it is paramount to foster mutual understanding, especially in this age where international and regional conflicts bulge.
I believe that cultural psychology prospect can be a bridge to facilitate this understanding.
My experiences have only reaffirmed my belief that culture, as an intrinsic environment, profoundly impacts our mindset and behaviour.
Meta-analysis shows \autocite{henrich_weirdest_2010} most psychological studies are predominantly from Western scholars, and the sample used is mainly from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (``WEIRD'') societies.
leading to a lack of practical findings relevant to Eastern countries.
This limitation, which I noticed during my undergraduate studies, raised critical questions: How do we ensure that psychological research is universally applicable? How do we bridge the knowledge gap between Western and Eastern psychologies?
The juxtaposition of my academic pursuits and extracurricular activities has allowed me to appreciate the importance of cultural psychology in our increasingly interconnected world.
My inclination towards cultural psychology is spurred by the observation of a significant gap in psychological data between Eastern and Western demographics.

These interests prompted me to undertake a demo study titled ``Cross-cultural Comparative Research of First-year Students' Adaptation'', which has spanned three months and remains a work in progress, focusing on understanding the commons and differences between cultures and the factors related to this result.
This study considers factors such as adolescent growth, socioeconomic status, and differences between internal and external coping mechanisms.
The aim is to comprehensively understand how cultural backgrounds influence students' adaptation to new environments.
My passion for psychology is not confined to my academic and research interests: It defines who I am and the contributions I aim to make to the world.

Although I approached professors for mentorship and found hesitance, it has not deterred me.
I remain steadfast in my goal, investing time into reading numerous papers and furthering my understanding.
I want to contribute significantly to bridging this gap through extensive research, focusing on illuminating the unexplored facets of psychology in different cultures.
Post-graduation, my vision is to continue contributing to the academic sphere, advancing the field of psychology through relentless research and exploration, and imparting acquired knowledge to the coming generations.
I aspire not only to further my studies with an undergraduate and postgraduate degree in psychology but also to remain within academia, advancing the field through research and teaching.

% 课内
When my interest in cultural psychology drives me, my dedication further underpinned my academic journey.%跟dedication什么关系
